# blockchain_rust

A blockchain based on proof of work implemented in Rust.

If you want to print the log info in terminal: `RUST_LOG=info cargo run <Subcommand> [Arguments]`

**CLI Command:**

Currently in development stage,we need add `cargo run` in each command.

```zsh
# print chain
cargo run printchain
# create wallet
cargo run createwallet
# create blockchain
cargo run createblockchain "[address]"
# get balance
cargo run getbalance "[address]"
# list all addresses
cargo run listaddresses
# send amount
cargo run send "[from address]" "[to address]" "[amount]"
```

New a block just has a transaction.Send transaction once,mine block once.
