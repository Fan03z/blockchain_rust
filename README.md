# blockchain_rust

A blockchain based on proof of work implemented in Rust.

If you want to print the log info in terminal: `RUST_LOG=info cargo run <Subcommand> [data]`

**CLI Command:**

Currently in development stage,we need add `cargo run` in each command.

```zsh
# printchain
cargo run printchain
# addblock
cargo run addblock "[data]"
```
